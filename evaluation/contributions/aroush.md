## App v1
- *Backend*
  - Created the *Job model* and *Job controller*.
  - Implemented CRUD operations for jobs.
  - Wrote comprehensive *test file* to validate CRUD functionality without authentication.
- *Deployment*
  - Deployed the v1 application.
  - Fixed issues encountered during deployment.

## App v2
- *Backend*
  - Added *route protection* for authentication.
  - Developed two dedicated *test suites*:
    - users.test.js for user signup/login.
    - jobs-auth.test.js for CRUD operations with authentication.
- *Deployment*
  - Successfully deployed the v2 application.

*Summary:*  
Focused primarily on backend development, I designed and tested job-related features in v1, then extended functionality in v2 by securing routes and adding authentication tests. I also handled deployments for both versions and resolved issues during it.
