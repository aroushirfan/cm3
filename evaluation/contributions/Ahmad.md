--> I contributed mainly to the frontend development of our project.

--> I implemented the complete Job Details Page, including dynamic job display, protected edit/delete buttons, and full integration with backend routes.

--> I also built and styled the Add Job Page, ensuring proper form handling and data submission.

--> In addition, I worked on the authentication system, creating the Signup page, managing session-based login state, and updating the Navbar to reflect authenticated and unauthenticated views.

--> My work ensures that users can sign up, log in, add new jobs, and manage (edit/delete) job listings smoothly.
