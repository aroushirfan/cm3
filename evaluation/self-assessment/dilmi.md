## Self Assessment

### Quality and Functionality of the code

  -  Implemented foundational routing structure for the backend API.
  -  Routes were organized clearly and followed REST conventions.
  -  Improved the user routing system, ensuring a clearer separation between controllers and routers.
  -  Middleware was written in a reusable and easily maintainable structure.

### Challenges Faced & How I Overcame Them

  -  Renaming controller files caused some import issues and required updates across other backend files.
    -  Solution: Performed a consistent rename throughout the entire backend.

### Reflection on What I Learned

  -  I became much more confident with creating and managing feature branches.
  -  Working within a shared repository taught me how to coordinate contributions and how to avoid merge conflicts.
