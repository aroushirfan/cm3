### Self-Grading – Hathadura

### Proposed Score: 70/80

This score is only for my own part of the project (Backend V2 user functionality).

### 1. Completion of My Tasks 

I successfully:

- Implemented the user model according to the given schema.
- Implemented the user controller used for user-related endpoints in API V2.
- Tested the endpoints using Postman with realistic request bodies.

I focused on the parts I was responsible for (user model + controller + testing in Postman) and completed them.

## 2. Code Quality & Organization 

- The user model is structured clearly and matches the assignment requirements.
- The controller logic is separated into its own file, which keeps the code maintainable.
- I used meaningful names and tried to keep the code readable.
- Files are given from teacher's source.

I am taking a few points off because there is still room to:

### 3. Testing & Verification 

- I tested the user endpoints using **Postman**.
- I checked correct request bodies and responses.
- I fixed problems based on what I saw in Postman.

### 4. Git Workflow & Collaboration 

- I created two separate branches for my backend V2 work (user model and user controller).
- I kept branches as required 
- My work can be clearly seen in Git history.

### Final Comment

I believe 70*80 is a fair and honest score for my contribution:

- I completed my tasks (user model + controller + Postman testing).
- I followed the project rules (branching, structure).
