Self-Grading – Ahmad

Score: 76 / 80    --> Give it my all.

Justification

Code Quality & Organization
I maintained clean and readable code throughout the frontend. Pages like Job Details, Add Job, Signup were structured clearly with proper state handling and API integration. I ensured authentication logic remained consistent and easy to understand. Although the code works well, some parts (such as repetitive form handling) could be more modular.

Completion of Assigned Features
I fully completed my assigned tasks, including developing the Job Details page with edit/delete logic, creating the Add Job page, implementing Signup functionality, and improving authenticated route behavior. All major features were delivered and integrated with the backend. A few improvements remain, but overall the implementation is complete and functional.
